"[MAINCHAR] - your [Noun] is safe! FOR NOW..." a loud voice echoed in the distance
I mean come on, even a [Animal] could do this!
[MAINCHAR] said "I have a great joke about [Animal]s! Do you want to hear it?"
He had a [Animal] friend
Please don't feed the animals
[Name] was killed by a wild [Animal]
[MAINCHAR] ran into a [Adjective] [Animal] in the forest.
"I only eat meat from [Animal]s that I have personally killed and butchered"
"I would really love a [Food] right now..."
[MAINCHAR] decided to cook some [Food] on the BBQ
[MAINCHAR] was busy eating some [Food] when [PLOTTWIST]
[MAINCHAR] walked to the [Location]
"Wow, isn't it strange? The sky is kinda [Color] today." [MAINCHAR] thought.
Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.
The next day, a [Animal] happened to pass by the lane where [MAINCHAR] lived
So [MAINCHAR] knocked on the door and said: "Do you have any [Noun]"
"Wow, that's a nice [Noun]!'" he said
But that never asked [MAINCHAR] from asking question, and the most important question was: "What the hell is a [Unknown]"?
[MAINCHAR] took some sugar, spice and [Food], and mixed them all well together to create a strange [Color] potion
The [Adjective] [Animal] turned round as fast as it could, which wasn’t very fast
[Name] the [Animal] showed up, yelling, "Help! A weird [Unknown] fell out of my chimney"
Sometimes, [Unknown] is just not going to cut it.
"What is a [Unknown], really?! Can I eat that?" [MAINCHAR] was seriously confused.
Then the [Animal] [Verb]ed in good earnest, and jumped up on his feet to see what it was that he should stop.
[MAINCHAR] thought at once that the [Animal] must have stolen the [Noun]
"Have you ever seen a [Verb]ing monster?!" [MAINCHAR] cried in disbelief
"I've seen a lot of things in my time," [MAINCHAR] said, "but I have never seen a [Unknown]"
[MAINCHAR]'s face was starting to turn [C]
[MAINCHAR] loved going to the [Location], even when it rained.
"Have you ever been to the [Location]? It's not far from here!" [MAINCHAR] said to a random [ANIMAL] that was passing by.
The place was full of random [Thing], which was kinda weird really.
[MAINCHAR] and [NAME] the [ANIMAL] first met at a [Thing] collectors conference.
