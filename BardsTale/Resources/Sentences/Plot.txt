"[MAINCHAR] - your [NOUN] is safe! FOR NOW..." a loud voice echoed in the distance
I mean come on, even a [ANIMAL] could do this!
[MAINCHAR] said "I have a great joke about [ANIMAL]s! Do you want to hear it?"
He had a [ANIMAL] friend
Please don't feed the animals
[NAME] was killed by a wild [ANIMAL]
[MAINCHAR] ran into a [ADJECTIVE] [ANIMAL] in the forest.
"I only eat meat from [ANIMAL]s that I have personally killed and butchered"
"I would really love a [FOOD] right now..."
[MAINCHAR] decided to cook some [FOOD] on the BBQ
[MAINCHAR] was busy eating some [FOOD] when [PLOTTWIST]
[MAINCHAR] walked to the [LOCATION]
Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.
The next day, a [ANIMAL] happened to pass by the lane where [MAINCHAR] lived
So [MAINCHAR] knocked on the door and said: "Do you have any [NOUN]"
"Wow, that's a nice [NOUN]!'" he said
But that never asked [MAINCHAR] from asking question, and the most important question was: "What the hell is a [UNKNOWN]"?
She took some sugar, spice, [FOOD] and [FOOD], and mixed them all well together to create a potion
The [ADJECTIVE] [ANIMAL] turned round as fast as she could, which wasn’t very fast
[NAME] the [ANIMAL] showed up, yelling, "Help! A weird [UNKNOWN] fell out of my chimney"
Sometimes, [UNKNOWN] is just not going to cut it.
"What is a [UNKNOWN], really?!" [MAINCHAR] was seriously confused.
Then the [ANIMAL] [VERB]ed in good earnest, and jumped up on his feet to see what it was that he should stop.
He thought at once that the [ANIMAL] must have stolen the [NOUN]
"Have you ever seen a [VERB]ing monster?!" [MAINCHAR] cried in disbelief
"I've seen a lot of things in my time," [MAINCHAR] said, "but I have never seen a [UNKNOWN]"
