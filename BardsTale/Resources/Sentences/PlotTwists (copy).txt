a huge dinosaur appeared out of nowhere!
a super loud bang!! What was that??!
his mommy came running out of the kitchen
the neighbor's cat jumped out of the roof and landed on its head
a fat bird came crashing down from the sky!
twenty zombies appeared out of nowhere and started running in circles
the washing machine beeped - 'BEEP! BEEP!'. Maybe the washing is done?
the oven timer beeped - 'OH! THAT MUST BE MY PIZZA!'
